# 2023 Mathematics REU List
## Description: 
This page contains a directory of 2023 Research Experience for Undergraduates (REUs) aimed at mathematics students. This directory is built automatically using a combination of Python, Github Actions, and data obtained from [MathPrograms](https://www.mathprograms.org) and [https://sites.google.com/view/mathreu](Math REU Programs). It is updated everyday at exactly 12:00 AM. In the future, I will update the program to pull from multiple REU sites.
